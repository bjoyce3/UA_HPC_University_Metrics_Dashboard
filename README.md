# UA_HPC_University_Metrics_Dashboard
A repository to create an automatic dashboard for (Higher Education Research and Development Survey (HERD))[https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvyherd/], (The Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS))[https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/], and University of Arizona-specific metrics. 

## Project Requirements
- All data must be pulled from the original databases (i.e. HERD, IPEDS, etc)
-- 

# How to Run This Project

## Jupyter Notebooks
- All Jupyter notebooks are available in this repository as [Git Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
-- Newer versions of the submodule notebooks (and other code) may be available on [Chris Deer](https://github.com/CGDeer/HERD_Analysis.git) and [Cynthia Hart's](https://github.com/cbresloff/IPEDS_DATA.git) subrepositories
-- These submodules are pulled here based on Git commit hashes

# Project Design and Execution
- Initial coding and data cleaning efforts were committed to GitHub Repos of Cynthia Hart () and Chris Deer ().
